## Solution of leetcode problems
This is my solution of leetcode problems. Each Problem with index `k` is named `Pk`. Start from a point, I began writing some simple test cases, mostly copy from the sample input/output for the problem. This little trick helps a great deal to increase the acceptance rate. 
## Beyond Solution
Besides the solution, I also add some extra flavor, mostly the implementation of common or not that common data structures, to be shared between different problem solutions. I also write a simple parser to parse arguments, especially for `TreeNode`, in case of construct the whole tree with bare hands.
